# Classification

## An Overview of Classification

Note:  The section numbers of this document match up with ISLR.  The equation numbers match up with the section, but you need to append "4." to the number.

A factor variable can be called *qualitative*, *categorical*, or other names that indicate that it takes on a finite number of *classes*, *levels*, or *factors*.  When the output variable is qualitative, the process of prediction is called *classification* rather than regression.

This section of ISLR covers four methods of classification:  

* logistic regression,

* linear discriminant analysis (LDA),

* quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and

* K-nearest neighbors (KNN).

Other classifiers are covered in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
